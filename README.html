This is an updated version of the Chinese Support add-on, designed to work with Anki 2.1. If you are new to this add-on, the wiki from the previous version is still relevant (<a href="https://github.com/ttempe/chinese-support-addon/wiki" rel="nofollow">here</a>). The core feature of the add-on is its automatic filling of fields, with audio generation, tone colouring and translation.

<b><i>Status</i></b>

The vast majority of features have been successfully ported, and the add-on is in a usable state, albeit with some definite rough edges.

The add-on is still in beta. By this I mean “it works, but I wouldn’t trust it with my children”. Expect occasional issues, and please make a back-up before trying it. I use it myself and haven't experienced data loss, but <i>your</i> mileage may vary.

Development code is hosted on GitHub (<a href="https://github.com/luoliyan/chinese-support-redux" rel="nofollow">here</a>). That is the best place to <a href="https://github.com/luoliyan/chinese-support-redux/issues" rel="nofollow">report issues</a>. Feature requests are also welcome.

<b><i>Usage</i></b>

The core feature of the add-on is the automatic field filling. To take advantage of this, you need to have an Anki note type with the appropriate fields (e.g., <b>Hanzi</b>, <b>Meaning</b>, <b>Reading</b>, <b>Sound</b>). If you don't already have such a note type, the easiest way to create one is to use the built-in model:

<ol><li>Navigate to Tools → Manage Note Types (or press <code>Ctrl+Shift+N</code>)</li><li>Click <b>Add</b></li><li>Select <b>Add: Chinese (basic)</b></li><li>Click <b>OK</b></li><li>Click <b>OK</b> again</li><li>Click <b>Close</b></li></ol>
Then, to use the field filling features:

<ol><li>Add a new note to Anki (press <code>a</code>)</li><li>Select <b>Chinese (basic)</b> as the note type</li><li>Enable Chinese Support Redux for this note type (click <b>汉字</b>)</li><li>Enter a word (e.g., 電話) in the <b>Hanzi</b> field</li><li>Press <code>Tab</code></li><li>The remaining fields should then be populated automatically</li></ol>
