chinese-support-addon
=====================

Addon for Anki2 to ease the burden of Chinese learners, in the continuation of batterseapowerâ€™s pinyin-toolkit for Anki1.

Seen http://ospalh.github.com/chinese-support-addon/ for instructions.

Current features include :
* automatic addition of pinyin and tone colorization to hanzi fields
* ability to handle multiple chinese synonyms in the same note
* simple Google Translate support for filling in translation

More to come :
* support for pronounciation through Awesome TTS
* more robust dictionary lookup
* grahps for showing number of single Hanzi, words or meanings learned

This is work-in-progress. Please join in or drop me a note if you think you can do something usefull. I do not intend to push development much further beyond what is immediately useful for me and plan to keep things simple.
