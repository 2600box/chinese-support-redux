chinese-support-addon
=====================

Addon for Anki2 that may one day do some of the things that batterseapower’s pinyin-toolkit did for Anki1

Seen http://ospalh.github.com/chinese-support-addon/ for instructions.

Please do not expect too much from this. This is pretty much a hobby project. (I don’t even learn Chinese.) If anyone wants to do real work, ey is welcome to fork this or to send pull requests.

This will be more closely modeled after Damien’s Japanese support addon. (And actually use copies of some of that code.)

A number of the more “advanced” features of the pinyin-support toolkit will not be re-done:
* While i see that hanzi statistics would be interesting, i’m not interested in re-doing that.
* The whole put-pronunciation-together-from-mp3-snippets seemed a bit strange to me. Go get a pronunciation of the whole word from somewhere else.
